## Overview
This project is aimed at creating a React application that leverages Axios to fetch data from two different third-party APIs. The backend consists of two APIs, one for retrieving weather information and another for fetching movie data. The frontend will then utilize a location API to enhance user experience.

## Getting Started

To begin working with this project, start by cloning the repository to your local machine using the provided repository URL. After cloning, navigate to the project directory using the terminal and run the command npm install to install the necessary dependencies. Once the backend is set up, initiate the server by executing the command npm start.

Next, open a new terminal window and navigate to the 'frontend' directory within the project. Run npm install to install the frontend dependencies, and then start the React application with npm start. This will launch the application on http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

The project architecture consists of a backend built with Node.js and Express.js, utilizing the Axios library for asynchronous API requests. Two APIs are integrated into the backend, one for fetching weather information and another for retrieving movie data. On the frontend, React and Axios are used to dynamically update the user interface based on the data received from these APIs. Additionally, a location API enhances user interaction.

Follow these steps to get the project up and running, and explore the functionalities of the React application with integrated weather, movie, and location APIs.

## Architecture

The application is built using the following technologies:

Backend:

Node.js
Express.js
Axios
Frontend:

React
Axios
The backend has two APIs, one for weather information and another for movies. The frontend uses the Axios library to make asynchronous requests to these APIs and dynamically updates the UI based on the received data. Additionally, a location API is utilized to enhance user interaction.
